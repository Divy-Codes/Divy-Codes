## <Hello World/> 👋
You can call me Divyanshu. Based out of Delhi/Bengaluru, I am an artisan of the digital with websites and UIs my tapestries. Programming is like art to me, it excites me and gives me a sense of purpose.
I am also a tech enthusiast who believes in progressive tech and change. 

## My Work
- This is my Mangum Opus, A Youtube Frontend made using the publicly Available Youtube API. You can check it out here 🔗[Youtube-Frontend](https://divyanshu-yt-frontend.web.app/auth)
- I also made a MArkdown Supported Note Taking app with dark and light modes. Do not let the simplicity fool you. An app whose entire UI changes on every user interaction is very good exercise in React. Check it out [here.](https://web-notes-2024.web.app/)
- Last and in fact the least(🤡), is a spotify frontend. This was my first project as a programmer so make your judgements keeping this in view. Check out the code [here.](https://github.com/Divy-Codes/SpotifyClient)

## In another world...
In another world I am into fiction and non-fictions. I am a die-hard fan of Ursula K Le Guin. Give me a ping if you too have read the The dispossessed. Ofcourse Literature only makes sense with some progressive politics.
I am also an amateur Badminton🏸player.

## What am I doing Right now⁉️
I was obviously not going to stop at Frontend. I have thirst for more ("Ye Dil mange more"). Currently learning the python(With Django) alongside NextJS.
